1. Install the required ZFS utilities:

    ```bash
    apt install zfsutils-linux zfs-dkms zfs-zed
    ```

2. Check the device names of your disks:

    ```bash
    ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/
    ```

3. Create a ZFS pool with your SSDs as a mirrored pair and your NVMe as cache:

    ```bash
    zpool create tank0 mirror /dev/disk/by-id/<disk1_id> /dev/disk/by-id/<disk2_id>
    zpool add tank0 cache /dev/disk/by-id/<nvme_id>
    ```

4. Create a new ZFS filesystem for the `<user_name>` user's home directory in your ZFS pool `tank0`:

    ```bash
    sudo zfs create tank0/home
    ```

    This command will create a new ZFS filesystem at `/tank0/home`.

5. Ensure that you have a recent backup of the data you are about to move.

6. Copy the contents of the current home directory to the new location. You should do this while logged in as a different user to avoid any issues with files being in use:

    ```bash
    sudo rsync -aXS /home/<user_name>/. /tank0/home/<user_name>/.
    ```

    This command preserves all file attributes and hard links.

7. Rename the original home directory to keep it as a backup:

    ```bash
    sudo mv /home/<user_name> /home/<user_name>_old
    ```

8. Change the home directory for the user `<user_name>`. You'll need to edit `/etc/passwd`:

    ```bash
    sudo vipw
    ```

    Find the line starting with `<user_name>` and change `/home/<user_name>` to `/tank0/home/<user_name>`.

9. Set the mount point of your ZFS file system to the new home directory:

    ```bash
    sudo zfs set mountpoint=/tank0/home tank0/home
    ```

10. Login as `<user_name>` and verify that all your files are present in your new home directory and everything works as expected.

11. After you have verified that everything works as expected, you can remove the old home directory:

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /home/<user_name>_old
    ```

Remember, always backup your data before performing operations like this, and verify your new setup is working correctly before removing any backups. Also, if you have any services or applications that rely on specific file paths in your home directory, you may need to update those as well.
